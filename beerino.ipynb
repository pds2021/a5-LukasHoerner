        "Drinking beer is a challenging task on its own. On top of that, the process of choosing the beer to drink is one of the main problems to solve since the origin of human kind! Especially during the pandemic, this process got even more difficult: While one could just ask the waiter for a recommendation or just pick the most famous beer in a bar, this totally changed since bars are closed now. For this reason, beerino helps you to pick the right beers while shopping. Just upload a picture of the beer you want to buy and beerino will show you the rating from <a href=\"https://bierbasis.de/\">bierbasis.de</a> - one of Germanys biggest websited to rate beer.\r\n",

If beerino cannot provide the right answer, you can check <a href=\"https://github.com/pds2021/a5-LukasHoerner/releases/download/0.1/available_categories.txt\">here</a>, if the app supports your chosen beer.\r\n",
